This a program for a complex number calculator.
Both the parts, i.e. Complex class implementation and corresponding main for a calculator implementation are in the same source file to avoid duplication.

1. Enter a number, if complex, enter as a+bi.
2. Press an operator key. If you wish to perform the unary operation of norm, negative or conjugate, press 'm', 'n', 'z' respectively.
   The result shall be displayed. If a binary operation (+,-,*,/) is required to be carried out, press the required key.
3. If a binary operator has been entered, enter another number (as step 1).
4. The result is displayed.
5. More operations can be performed on the result; if you want to add something to the result, repeat from step 2.
6. To start another calculation, press 'c' and then 'y'. To quit, press 'c' and then any key.
